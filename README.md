# FEA_1D
This Repo consists of Code for Finite Element Analysis of a 1D Beam using MATLAB

The Structural Analysis problem is a basic but an important problem to understand the numerical methods behind the working of complication FEA and CFD simulation problems. In the following code, I solved the differential equation with the primary variable being the displacement and the secondary variable being the force (both distribtuted and concentrated).
